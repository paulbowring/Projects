# Projects
These are my projects of coding experience

My primary focus is on python programming at the moment, so I'm hoping to do alot of coding in python with a focus into django web framework and then on a app level ceating a functional app using Kivy to convert my python code into a functional app.

I'm going to put together little reminders and read me files for each project and see where it all takes me.
